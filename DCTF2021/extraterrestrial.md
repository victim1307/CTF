## Extraterrestrial Communication (200 pts)(misc_mp3/Audio_Analysis)
Aliens have recently landed on the moon and are attempting to communicate with us. Can you figure out what they are trying to tell us?

## Solution:
As the chall said the audio might be SSTV.
So i used QSSTV initially but it didn't work well do i shifted to Robot36.
There is an app in playstore for Robot36 :https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xdsopl.robot36&hl=en_IN&gl=US.
I played the audio given and got an image.
