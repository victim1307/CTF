### Solution
The .zip contains these standard CD files:
`dawgTunes.cdda
.checksum.md5`
The .cdda file contains audio data so letâ€™s convert it to a listenable format with https://convertio.co/cdda-wav/
The audio is then a series of short and long tones which we can immediately suspect to be Morse Code:
which was transcribed as `... ----- ... .. ... -. --- - - .... . .- -. ..... .-- ...-- .-.` and decoded to be S0SISNOTTHEAN5W3R

Flag: `DawgCTF{S0SISNOTTHEAN5W3R}`
