If you can find a way to part the waves, you might find something on the seafloor.

### Solution:
The .zip file contains moses1.flac and moses2.flac with almost identical spectrograms. This is viewed using Spek.
To find out the difference between these 2 audios, we can do a phase inversion in Audacity.
Import both tracks into Audaciity
Select one track and apply the Invert Effect on it.
Select both tracks and Mix and Render
Export the new track

The flag is now at the bottom of the spectrogram of the new track.
